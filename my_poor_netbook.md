The end of the recharging cable for my netbook finally wore out one last time. I've [repaired it many times]({{site.url}}/posts/my_poor_power_brick.html), but it finally was so badly damaged that I couldn't fix it. I shaved the connector to get to the wire over and over with each repair until there was no wire left to find.

So I hacked off the power connector from an Eee PC 701, disassembled my netbook, and wired the 'new' connector to the old one. There wasn't room in my netbooks case for the connector without hacking out something, so I encased the connector and made it stick out of the lock hole (not sure what that's called) as a nub. It's ugly but it works really well and isn't too annoying.
