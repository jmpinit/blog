I connected a an old pen plotter to the Internet using an Arduino + Ethernet Shield + Easy Driver + SN754410 Quad Half H-Bridge IC. When I point a web browser to it's IP address I see a webapp that lets me:

* drag and drop photos for vectorized or rasterized plotting
* manually control the plotter by dragging the components of a schematic representation of it
* control the plotter RESTfully
