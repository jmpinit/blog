Rules
-----
	
1. Only use scrap or parts on hand.
2. Fit as much functionality into as small a space as possible.
3. This is not a regular watch damn it! INFUSE IT WITH CREATIVITY!


Tease
-----

* Infrared temperature sensing?
* Accelerometer?
* Calculator backup?
* IR communication?
* Synthesizer?

Seems appropriate for going into my senior year in high school. I've been needing some proper geek swag.
