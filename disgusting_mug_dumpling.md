Ingredients:
------------
* 2 eggs
* Handful of flour
* Freshly used coffee grounds (from coffee made just before)
* A few pinches of cinnamon
* Maybe a little sugar to taste (I haven't tried)

How to Make:
------------
1. Throw ingredients in a mug
2. Mix well
3. Microwave for one minute (or however long it takes to look cooked - it will be obvious)

Taste:
------
Doesn't taste eggy. Tastes like a dense unsweetened coffee spongecake. I really like it.
