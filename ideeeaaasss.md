I have many more ideas pop into my head in the course of a day than the ones that I have ever taken the time to write about. Some manage to float through my mind long enough for them to come to be archived on a scrap of paper, but most keep floating until they just fade out of existence.

In an effort to keep more of those wispy ideas around I'm going to start posting them here. They can be found under the "Thought" category.
