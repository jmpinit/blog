I haven't had much time lately to write blog posts, but dumping links doesn't take very long.

Here's what I did at Codeday, with a group of three other really talented coders/designers who liked my idea, called [Many Little Pieces](https://github.com/jmptable/many-little-pieces/).Â We won "Most Innovative". We are continuing development on it because a bunch of people told us they like the idea. Deployment to Heroku or Nodester in the near future is likely.

And I am going to [Toorcamp](http://toorcamp.org/)! Wooohoo!
