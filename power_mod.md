This is the gross battery charger connector for my netbook. I repaired it more than a dozen times until it finally was unworkable. I needed to charge the battery so I added a new connector to the computer.

Here's the nasty old splice on the charger wire.

I cut it out and made a nice new straight splice:

And stole a power connector from an EEE PC 701 motherboard:

Then I encased it in a plastic enclosure I found in my parts bin and wired it to the original connector of my netbook.

Here it is booted up without a battery, running power across the new connector:

And here's what it looks like all buttoned up:
