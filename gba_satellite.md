A little dongle plugs into the top of a Gameboy Advance. On powerup, the Gameboy boots into a homebrew program. The program allows a tiny mechanical satellite to be controlled remotely. Pictures can be taken by the satellite's [Gameboy Camera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera) and beamed to the GBA's screen.

Right now just a concept. Goal is to be a first foray into playing with the Gameboy Advance multiboot protocol.

Other possibilities
-------------------

* dongle turns GBA into a wireless PC controller like that of the Wii U
* general-purpose robot controller
