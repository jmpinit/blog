During MIT orientation week I received a total of 3 bags during various activities. They're crappy cheap fabric drawstring bags, but they have been very useful for lugging things like books around. I have turned one of them into a [liver](http://dnok91peocsw3.cloudfront.net/inspiration/87072-612x612-1.png) bag. It's inspired by the human liver and that bag that guy wears in that video game about assassins my brothers play all the time (I'm kidding, the game is Assassin's Creed and I'm talking about [Desmond Mile's backpack](http://i43.tinypic.com/2u3wm5s.jpg)).

Why I made it
-------------

When I go places I often just want to bring my e-reader, a notebook, and some writing Â and drawing stuff (nice pens/pencils of different colors). Using my full backpack for that is silly, because I either have to take all of the stuff out besides what I want to bring in order to lighten the load, or lug way more than I need. This little liver bag fits a little niche for me.


How I made it
-------------

I took one of those bags I mentioned earlier and cut one side off (the side with crappy designs and lettering). I then stitched the other side together with gardener's twine, two screwdrivers, an exacto knife blade, and a fragment of zip tie that I shaved down to a point. I've never sewn anything before that I can remember, so I made all of this up as I went. I cut a hole for the twine with the exacto, enlarged it with the screwdrivers, and then passed my needle through. After I finished that I went back and tied knots along the whole length of the stitch to strengthen it. I made up that knotting system, but I think it turned out very well. The stitch is very strong and doesn't seem like it will fall apart.

The end product
---------------

I am very happy with this little project. It is extremely comfortable to wear because it hugs the body and doesn't jostle around while moving. It's the perfect size for my notebooks and tools. I think it looks pretty. Maybe I will play around with textile/clothing projects more in the future.
