THURSDAY
--------

We woke up way too early after going to sleep way too late and packed everything into the car/uhaul and left. The first hurdle was the ferry. We waited in line and anon grabbed a little food from McDonalds. anon and I typed on stuff in the car. A guy came by asking for money and I confusedly thought he might be a guy in charge of directing ferry traffic who was trying to get our attention. anon corrected me and I think I gave her the impression that I am clueless.

We made it on the ferry and got out of the car. It was a very pretty ride across the water. We found a spot with power and charged our gadgets. At the other side we headed off looking for someplace to get food and ice but got lost. anon almost made a very dangerous turn to get us flipped around but instead we continued down the road and found another way back. We stopped at a Safeway. The only thing I could think of to get was a coffee, so I went to the internal Starbucks and bought one. I also went to the bathroom and found something interesting. It was in the innards of the supermarket where they stage all of the food before putting it on the shelves. The door was propped open. On the wall was a sharps container. It was either for people doing drugs or for someone(s) who was/were diabetic. Probably the latter.

With ice we headed out on the long portion of the journey. The 3G started to die off and then there was only the EDGE network. I was trying to download the Arduino IDE and other files to work with Nibble. I let it download for a very long time but eventually it failed. The countryside was gorgeous. We stopped at a gas station along the way and I learned some things about ShadyTel from anon. Mostly that it uses a BST and a satellite connection to the outside world. I was having trouble following her.

We got back on our way and the network started dying out. Within a short time it was just GSM voice. Then there was no cell network at all. We made it to Neah bay and then kept going. Hobuck resort was some distance past the edge of the reservation. When we arrived we found a tent where we could sign in. They didn’t have Internet and so took me at my word when I told them my code. They gave us bracelets to identify us as having paid, and cloth bags with a few items inside. There was a water bottle, a shirt, and a garbage bag.

We drove to where HBL’s space was allocated and found anon. He had set up his tent down in a crater on the way to the beach adjacent to our space. We then started surveying our land and figuring out where things should go. The first thing we set up was the kitchen. I went and set up my tent in a cool littlle hidy hole I found. It was along the trail towards the beach inside of the treeline separating the camp from the beach. Oddly there was a red Native American shirt blocking the path, tied to a low treebranch at the arms. It was just hanging down so I moved it out of the way. I had a guess that it was either silly or very serious, maybe a way to mark a burial site or similar. But I took a chance and continued past it anyway to find a little clearing surrounded by trees. On the edge of the clearing closest to the beach I found a tunnel through very thick branches leading down to an enclosed section of ground covered in pine needles. It was a secret spot and just barely big enough for a tent. I decided almost immediately to set up there.

Setting up the tent was easy. I returned to the main area and helped set some stuff up. Then I think I went and watched talks at the Prime Dome. I saw a guy explain the biology of the area and how it was all interrelated, a bro explain his growerbot, and anon give her explanation of her experience coaching people towards success. She seemed to be a little stressed maybe, and was having trouble getting the audience to be responsive. But her talk was interesting and brought up good points about what could be accomplished on the mental health side of the hacker community.

FRIDAY
------

So it is extremely early on Friday morning right now. The music is pumping and I can't sleep. The bass is a pervasive force that twists your guts. I'll take a moment to record what I saw yesterday. In no particular order:

* Noisebridge is building a giant rocket-ship shaped metal-pole-triangle structure. A guy climbed up to the top to secure it. It's maybe 30 or 40 feet tall.
* A castle on a truck with dance-floors and massive subwoofers.
* A giant geodesic dome (the Prime Dome) where talks are held.
* An open source robot made of a wheelchair, with a robot arm.
* The amazing Tesla Gun. The guy who made it gave the last talk and then demonstrated it out on the beach when it got dark. He made a lot of it at Hackerbot Labs so he knows the people from there so he came by our camp and I talked with him a bit. He's a guy who knows how to get people excited about technology without really trying. He's just genuinely passionate and excited about it himself, and good at conveying that.
* A horrible project - laser finger gloves. This guy stuck high-powered green lasers on gloves and then wore them on his hands. It was certainly an amazing effect, but also extremely dangerous. It was clear the guy didn't recognize how dangerous they were. He could have easily caused a terrible irreparable injury to someone's eyes. Thankfully I don't think he did.
* The amazing Mitch Altman, creator of the TV B Gone, teaching people the basics of electronics. He knows a lot, and is very good at educating people. It was a pleasure to listen in on his class while I was putting Nibble together in the Hardware Hacking Village.
* A very weird internet infrastructure and phone system to match. The internet has been in and out since I got here, but apparently only because the DNS keeps getting messed up. Some of the network hackers figured out how to keep a stable connection by changing their DNS settings, but I am not so good at networking stuff and have not gotten someone to give me a thorough explanation on how to fix it. The ShadyTel phone system is a different story. I don't have an unlocked phone to test it, but apparently it works fairly well. An extremely interesting system that takes advantage of recent developments in reverse-engineering GSM. There are antennaes for it on the beach and in the middle of camp. The theory I've heard circulating is that it routes through the satellite network connection.
* Insane bass. I'm off in the woods a few hundred feet from the main party area but I feel the music in my guts like I'm right there. I'm one who really hates that kind of partying because it is so loud so I'm not feeling so well right now. I need sleep so I can see more cool stuff! Gah.

Interestingly I've met a bunch of people who went to MIT here, including anon, who was around when MITERS began.

Food is weird here. Everyone is kind of winging it. My tummy isn't very happy. There's lots of cheese for some reason. And thousands of fruit snacks. Thankfull I did get some awesome dinner from generous people in the group within HBL who bought into a proper food plan. I had some cured meat that is causing my stomach troubles.

We set up an evil car port from Harbor Freight. It was very poorly designed.

SATURDAY
--------

anon told me about the Parrot AR Drone that he had in the back of the lab truck. He let me play with it. It's a $300 quadcopter that can be piloted via a mobile app on Android or iPhone. anon help me set it up. One of the motors had some grit inside and was seizing up. I took it apart several times to clean it out and eventually got it working okay. I asked the Noisebridge folks repairing their bus for some oil to lubricate it. They were very excited about helping.

anon let me use his old iPhone to control the drone. It didn’t work very well like that. I had trouble getting it to respond. He managed to fly it okay though after a bit of practice. He was very aggressive with the controls, turning the response all the way up, and ended up crashing the drone several times.

I downloaded the SDK for the drone and tried to get it working but I couldn’t compile it on my computer. It was designed to compile on Ubuntu but I am running Crunchbang. Eventually I found a Python library that reimplemented the protocol. The demo application that came with that allowed me to fly the drone using the keys on my netbook’s keyboard. It was very very fun.

But then I was hit with a bolt of inspiration. I brought my bluetooth-enabled TI 84+ to Toorcamp with me. When I remembered that I immediately knew what to do. I feverishly started writing code to let me control the drone using my calculator. The first challenge was to make my calculator connect to my computer at all. I had to install a bluetooth utility and set it up to start on boot. Then I had to figure out how bluetooth SPPs work on Debian. It turns out that using a tool called rfcomm I could map a bluetooth device and channel to a port in /dev/. Once it was properly mapped I could grab bytes from and send bytes to my calculator.

Right about at that point anon got a hold on the drone. anon let him fly it and of course pretty much the first thing he did was to crash it in the trees. He flew it very high until it lost signal and started flying away off into space. After a short bit it ran out of power or decided to land and ended up in an unknown location past the edge of camp on the side farthest from the beach. A big crowd of people went looking for it. It took about half an hour but anon eventually was able to climb up in a tree and knock it down. I grabbed it back from them as soon as I could and continued working on my code. It didn’t take long for me to get a simple python script together using pyserial to read the messages from my calculator and use them to trigger commands sent to the drone. I was incredibly happy and excited when I made the calculator instruct the drone to lift off the ground. With a bunch of tweaks I had pretty good control over it.

A bunch of people came by when they saw the drone flying around, and many liked that I was controlling it with my calculator. Eventually the Shadytel guys came by and I met one of the guys who helped cause the Texas Instruments signing key controversy. He explained that he has done a lot of cool projects with Texas Instruments calculators. He’s got a partially done z80 emulator for the TI 89 on Github.

The other guy who came from the ShadyTel tent is an intern with anon's company. He was really excited by the drone and went and got his 1 watt usb wifi adapter. It only took him a little while to set it up with my computer and the drone. It was working at 500 milliwatts though because he couldn’t change the country code easily (it’s legal in the U.S. to have a 1 watt WiFi transmitter but not in Europe). We flew the drone extremely high and far using the better transmitter.

While I was still playing with the drone 3ric came ofer to me with an idea. He wanted to know if I could make the laser transmit morse code. I wanted to finish my experiments with the drone so I put off that idea for a bit. But eventually I ran down the battery for the drone and the other one wasn’t finished charging, so I decided to take on anon's idea.

It turned out to be harder than I thought at first, as things usually are. It took a while to find anon because he disappeared to take a nap or something. I checked out the laser on my own and then found anon and asked him if he knew how to set it up. anon was gung-ho about it and we started preparing things. Suddenly anon was there ready to help and got the laser pumping. I moved into the car port nearby and started hacking on an Arduino program designed to make the laser pulse Morse code, but eventually failed because I was sleepy. anon took some pictures of Nibble for Hackaday and then I went to sleep.
